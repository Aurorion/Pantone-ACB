I uploaded these Pantone+ color books because of the removal in newer versions of Adobe products.
These are extracted from the last version the colorbooks were available in. *(2023)*


### Why are the Pantone Color Libraries removed from my Adobe Creative Cloud apps?

> Pantoneâ€™s licensing with Adobe was adjusted. Due to this change, customers will need to purchase Pantone Connect licenses to access Pantone colors in Adobe Creative Cloud products.

### Down below are install instructions for some products.
**Step 1**: Click on the green "<> Code" button and download the contents of this repository as a .ZIP file.

**Step 2**: Extract the contents of the .ZIP file somewhere on you PC. *(f.e. your desktop)*

**Step 3**: Navigate to where your Adobe products are installed on your pc. For me that would be:

 - Windows: X:\Program Files\Adobe
 - Mac OS: X:\Applications\Adobe

**Step 4**: Navigate to the following path:

 - Illustrator: **Adobe Illustrator 2024 > Presets > en_US > Swatches > Color Books**
 - Photoshop: **Adobe Photoshop 2024 > Presets > Color Books**
 - InDesign: **Adobe InDesign 2024 > Presets > swatch libraries**

**Step 5**: Paste the extracted contents of the .ZIP into the corresponding folder.

The Pantone+ color books are now avaible for use again in your Adobe products.
